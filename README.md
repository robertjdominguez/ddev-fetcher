# DominguezDev Fetcher

This is a simple utility application that is my first real foray into Rust. It uses several crates to make a GraphQL request
to my blog's (old) host, retrieve the posts' contents, and then create properly-formatted markdown files for each.

It will be used in conjunction with another service that acts as a server for a simple client-side application that will render the entire site.
